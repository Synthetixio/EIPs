## Simple Summary
Increase the fees on trades into sXAG, sFTSE, sAUD, sGBP and sCHF.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->
As per [sip-56](https://github.com/Synthetixio/SIPs/blob/master/SIPS/sip-56.md) each synth can now have its own fee levels. This SCCP suggest to raise the fees on synths as per the below breakdown:

## Motivation
Analysis of on-chain data showed that front-running opportunities were more accessible for certain synths. Increasing the fees as per the below should shrink that window significantly and bolster the protection until [sip-52](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-52) is implemented.


| Synth | New Fee (bp) |
|-------|-----------|
| sXAG  | 50        |
| sFTSE | 50        |
| sAUD  | 15        |
| sGBP  | 15        |
| sCHF  | 15        |
