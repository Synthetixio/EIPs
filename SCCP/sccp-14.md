## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->
Increase the C-RATIO required to claim fees/rewards by 50% (750% -> 800%).

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->
Both the sUSD and sETH pegs have persistently traded below their natural pair. Due to a general oversupply of synths and likely an overhang from frontrunners looking to exit the system, both pegs have traded well under parity recently. Increasing the C-RATIO will force stakers to bid up the prices of synths in order to use those synths to burn debt and claim.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
A weak peg shakes confidence in the project and makes it more difficult for traders to operate effectively. While the Arb Pool and discounted SNX auction have been somewhat successful in the past, they're expensive, artificial and short-term-minded. Toggling the C-RATIO is the native mechanism for exactly this problem.

A 50% increase may not have an immediate effect, especially with a two week claim period. But this is a step in the right direction and will likely show up in the peg at some point in the next two weeks. Additionally, the downsides of this change are limited. A 50% change won't "shock" the system or apply undue pressure to stakers. 

A further increase may be required if this proposal doesn't close the gap. But just owing to the fact that the community is pursuing a more active governance process, arbitrageurs may bid up the price of synths in expectation of pricing pressure.
