## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Raise exchange fees of trades into `iETH`by 25 bp to `0.75%` and on sETH to '0.50%'.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Increasing fees by 20 bp on sETH and by 25 bp on iETH should continue to narrow down the potential front-running gap.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Analysis of on-chain data showed that front-running continued to be possible on iETH, as the synth is close to it's lower limit. Furthermore, front-running on sETH is possible and raising fees to match the link push should help close the window.
