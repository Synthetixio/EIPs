## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Increase fees on trades into `iBNB` from 100 bp to 210 bp.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Proposing to increase fees on trades into `iBNB` as the leverage has increased significantly over the course of the day.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The fee increase is to account for higher leverage which has made it more possible to front-run the delayed oracle price push. Increasing fees to account for the leverage would help close that gap.
