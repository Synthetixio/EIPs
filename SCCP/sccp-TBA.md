## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Reduce fee reclamation waiting period to 3 minutes.


## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Based on analysis of recent on-chain data, it is possible to reduce the fee reclamation time back to the original 3 minutes.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Lower fee reclamation period helps significantly with the trading experience, it seems that 3 minutes is feasible at the moment. However, on chain activity will be consistently monitored to ensure that minters debt are not at risk.
