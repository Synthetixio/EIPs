## Simple Summary
We need to relaunch the Depot to accept deposits with ERC-20 functionality. 

## Abstract
Having removed the ERC-223 functionality from the Depot, we need to relaunch it with ERC-20 functionality to allow deposits once more, which are currently disabled. 

## Motivation
A depot is crucial for creating a simple Synth sink and allowing people to enter the system easily. This upgrade will re-enable Synth deposits.
