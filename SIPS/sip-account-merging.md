<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SIP.-->
Staking rewards are currently locked for 52 weeks from the date the are claimed, despite being locked they can still be used as collateral. One of the consequences of this is that a staker who has earned rewards in a wallet is forced to continue to maintain this wallet. The purpose of locking these staking rewards was to ensure that they were not able to be transferred, however, this creates a problem if a wallet is compromised or if a user would like to cycle wallets. This SIP proposes a compromise where a staker can transfer the entire balance of their staking rewards to a different wallet.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SIPs that want to change Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the SIP solves. SIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

## Test Cases

Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation.

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any SIP is given status "Implemented", but it need not be completed before the SIP is "Approved". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
