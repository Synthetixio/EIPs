# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to implement the following:

- Raise the `minKeeperFee` to 4$ from 2$
- Increase `maxLeverage` on all markets back to 100x

# Abstract

The parameters configurations description is as follows:
- `minKeeperFee` is the fee paid to the bots for executing a giver perp trade
- `maxLeverage` is the maximum leverage possible that doesn't cause a revert

# Motivation

The main motivation is the recent surge in gas cost which has priced out all decentralized keepers and increased the load on the centralized keeper funded by Treasury and is burning around 2 ETH per day. The max leverage increase is temporary until a patch goes throught on highly leveraged trades which are prevented to close/reduce their position when they are very near their respective liquidation threshold. That said, front-ends will be asked to keep the maximum leverage levels as per the specification [SCCP-293 ](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-293/) in order to avoid users getting into similar situations when they undertake highly leveraged positions.
