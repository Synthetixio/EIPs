# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase leverage on all crypto perps (including those mentioned in [SCCP-2000](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-2000/)) by 10%.

# Abstract

The `maxLeverage` is the maximum possible leverage to undertake on a given position.

# Motivation

The main motivation is to improve the ux, since between the time traders signal their intention to trade at max leverage, and the order actually gets executed, prices could move as to result in max leverage being exceeded and the order becoming stale.
