## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Disallowing new shorts and loans from being opened and existing loans from being drawn upon (i.e. increase in loan amount) by setting the `maxDebtLimit` to 1 wei and the `canOpen` variable to 0.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

- The `setCanOpen` function allows to disable new loans and shorts from being opened.
- Setting the `maxDebtLimit` to 1 wei, effectively blocks existing loans and shorts from being drawn down upon.


## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Loans and shorts were set to be deprecated, [SIP-273](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-273/) and [SCCP-146](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-146/). However, the shorting contracts were kept active in order to accord Lyra time to prepare for the transition towards Perps. With Lyra now set to tap into [perps](https://snapshot.org/#/lyra.eth/proposal/0x89bc59e634a54d75fb56710bd2804dc19acd707655700fee11ebf899f54d92bb) and having closed their existing short positions the product can be safely be prepared for sunset by setting the debt limit to 1 wei.
