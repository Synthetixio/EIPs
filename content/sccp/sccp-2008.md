## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SCCP intends to gradually sunset all abandoned positions on Perps V1 Markets, as some remain outstanding despite those markets being in close-only since they were switched to close-only mode as per [SIP-278](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-278/).
This is done by raising the `liquidationBufferRatio` 25 bp in gradual 25 bp steps per week, until all outstanding positions are liquidated. Furthermore, the `liquidationFeeRatio` would be lowered from 35 bp to 2 bp immediately, which results in snx stakers capturing the bulk of the liquidated margin.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

- The `liquidationBufferRatio` represents the proportion of a given position's size that needs to be collateralized by sUSD margin. Accounts who dont maintain enough margin to meet the `liquidationBufferRatio` requirement can be liquidated. 
- The `liquidationFeeRatio` is the compensation paid to the keeper in order to trigger liquidate event on an open position.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The primary motivation is to enforce sunsetting of outstanding positions in PerpsV1 in the least intrusive manner, leaving enough time for accounts with existing positions to close their positions.
