# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to apply the below configuration changes on the DAI wrapper:

- Lower the `maxTokenAmount`on the ethereum network from 20m DAI to 0
- Lower the `burnFeeRate` on the ethereum network from 50 bp to 0
- Lower the `minFeeRate` on the optimism network from 25 bp to 0

# Abstract

- The `maxTokenAmount` is the maximum amount of underlying that can be locked in order to issue a synth equivalent.
- The `mintFeeRate` is the fee rate applied when minting a synth by locking up an underlying.
- The `burnFeeRate` is the fee rate applied when burning a synth in order to unlock the underlying.

# Motivation

The primary motivation is to incentivize arbitrage of the imbalance between the ethereum and optimism wrappers. Over the last couple of months the optimism DAI wrapper went from having around 20m$ of DAI locked, to currently having only around 1m$ locked. With most of the sUSD activity taking place on optimism, it is important that the supply of wrappers be shifted to optimism, in order to facilitate the friction of acquiring and unloading large amount of sUSD. 
Allowing for this arbitrage to take place with these parameter changes will also help align the sUSD pegs between the two networks, currently being at 1.0005 on ethereum and 0.9995 on optimism.
