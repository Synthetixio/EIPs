# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to update the maxLiquidationDelta and maxPD parameters to 10 and 20 bp respectively on the FTM and BCH markets.

# Abstract

The parameter description is as follows:
- The `maxLiquidationDelta` is the maximum pd impact possible from a given liquidation, beyound which liquidation takes place via the endorsed liquidator.
 - The `maxPD` is the maximum pd distance from zero, beyound which liquidation takes place via the endorsed liquidator.

# Motivation

The `maxLiquidationImpact` parameter is normally calibrated as the sum of maker and taker offchain fees while `maxPD` is double `maxLiquidationImpact`.
The proposed changes in this SCCP are necessary, in order continue to rollout liquidations safely, taking into account the changes proposed in [SCCP-2019](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-2019/) which proposed to alter the offchain makerFee.
