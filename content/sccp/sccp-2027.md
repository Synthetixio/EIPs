# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to decrease the `maxTokenAmount` on the DAI wrapper to zero from 20 million sUSD.

# Abstract

The `maxTokenAmount` is the maximum amount of synth that could be minted against a deposited a designated underlying.

# Motivation

DAI was initially on-boarded in [SCCP-264](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-264/) in order to provide traders with synth liquidity and meet the growing demand for sUSD of the recently released perps v2. However, as we approach closer to the release of perps v3, along with the v3 staking system, a gradual phasing out DAI wrappers would make the transition to v3 easier. In addition, given the availablity of sUSD in [curve pools](https://curve.fi/#/optimism/pools/factory-v2-0/deposit) makes the process of moving away from DAI wrappers easier.
With the release of v3, sUSD would be much easier to acquire given multiple venues to mint it all within thought out risk controls that focus on skewness of stakers. 
It should be mentioned finally, that should there be a sudden surge in sUSD demand before the implementation of v3 reaches matures, there exists alternatives, in the form of LUSD, GHO and CRVUSD, with ample on-chain liquidity which can be on-boarded with wrappers in order to help meet the sUSD all the while diversifying the debt pool's exposure to counterparty risk.
