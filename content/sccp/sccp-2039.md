# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the `maxTokenAmount` on the ETH wrapper to zero from 15k ETH.

## Abstract

The `maxTokenAmount` is the maximum amount of ETH that can be wrapped to issue sETH.

## Motivation

The proposed proposed changes are in order to facilitate migration into V3, as well as limit the possibility of having a negative debt pool skew on ETH, when users acquire sUSD with ETH.
