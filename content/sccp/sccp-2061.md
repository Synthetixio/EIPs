# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the `exchangeFeeRate` on synth exchanges with fee reclamation on L1 from 50 bp to 10 bp.

# Abstract

The `exchangeFeeRate` is the fee rate applied on the amount being exchanged via conventional synth exchanges with fee reclamation. 

# Motivation

The proposed parameter changes are meant to facilitate arbitrage of the peg on L1, with arbitrages taking place buying cheap sUSD on L2, sending it to L1 and swapping it back to USDC via the ETH wrapper & synth exchanges.
