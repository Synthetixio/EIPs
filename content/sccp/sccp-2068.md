# Motivation

The motivation behind this sccp is to decrease the gas required to fetch the  debt of the system and allows us to list more markets on Perps V2. Aside from this, although these markets have largely been shutdown and contain no active positions, having them creates issues with debt being reported as `invalid` and the `debtCache` contract, due to legacy misconfigurations which have long been outlived. Deprecating these markets as outlined in this sccp removes any connections of the existing Perps system to the existing markets, without having any impact on the existing v2 markets.
