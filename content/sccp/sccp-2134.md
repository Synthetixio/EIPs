When opening a pull request to submit your SCCP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sccp-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

In preparation of allowing permissionless account migration from V2x to V3 on the ethereum network, and the full implementation of [SIP-306](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-306/), this SCCP proposes the following:
- Disable account merge on Ethereum and Optimism
- Disable issuance on Ethereum, by lowering the `issuanceRatio` to 1 wei
- Disable debt migration

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The changes required in order to ensure the rollout of permissionless migration of v2X staking accounts to V3 Core System.
