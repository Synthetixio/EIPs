# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to move the USDe held on the [ethereum wrapper](https://etherscan.io/address/0x293F72F9B288a16480135e876993861bf87ea56B) to the USDe [wrapper on optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xA1cABc35C2931F0d985Df58D19be8B6071DFc9F6).

# Abstract

Currently 5m USDe are held on the ethereum wrapper, while most of the trading activity is on optimism. This SCCP proposes to move the USDe to wrapper optimism, closer to traders, since USDe can be bridged instantly with the stargate bridge, giving traders instant access to stablecoin liquidity.
This is done by the protocol minting sUSD to release all the USDe on ethereum, send the USDe to optimism and wrap that USDe on L2. This is done along with raising the cap of the USDe wrapper on optimism to 15m sUSD and lower the cap on ethereum to 0. After this is performed the minted sUSD is burned ensuring that debt remains unchanged on stakers.

# Motivation

The proposed changes are in light of previous events where traders had preferred to swap the sUSD on optimism, instead of waiting for the 7 day relay from L2 to L1, causing temporary peg volatility. The changes proposed in this SCCP will help alleviate that volatility, by bringing instant liquidity closer to traders on optimism.
