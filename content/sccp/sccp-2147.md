# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to raise the `maxMarketValue` on the SOL market to 670k (175m dollars) from 550k.

# Abstract

The `maxMarketValue` is the limit set on open interest (longs or shorts).

# Motivation

The change is in light of the recent utilization of the limit on the SOL market which is quickly approaching 90%. Note that the market is backed by the size of the SNX staked, close to 370m$, given the deprecation of spot markets and legacy products.
