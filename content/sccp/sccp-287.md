## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Increase the `maxMarketValue` on ETH to 10,000 and BTC to 1,000, from 8,000 and 800 respectively.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The `maxMarketValue` is the maximum amount of open interest allowed on long and short positions in perp markets.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The main motivation is to increase the capacity on both the ETH and BTC markets as they are both near their current oi caps.
