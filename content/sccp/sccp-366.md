# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to decrease the minimum initial margin on both the base and arbitrum implementations to 15 USD.

# Abstract
The minimum position margin was specified during the pre-blob days, when trade settlement spiked for prolonged periods of time. This along with a review of the minimum keeper reward for executing liquidations and settling trades allows us to lower the minimum margin requirements without undue risk on the protocol.

# Motivation
The parameter change proposed in this SCCP was requested by one of our partner integrators in order to be able to onboard more traders on Arbitrum and Base.
