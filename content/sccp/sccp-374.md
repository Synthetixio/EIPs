# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to reduce the locked oi ratio on all perp markets to 0.25. Note that the multiplier is set to 0.5 on all markets except ETH and BTC markets where it's already set to 0.25.

# Abstract

The locked oi ratio determines the size of of oi allowed for a given LP backing. A ratio of 0.25 means that for each dollar of lp can back up to 4 dollars of oi.


# Motivation

The main motivation is to allow for larger open interest limits with the current size of the liquidity pool backing it.
