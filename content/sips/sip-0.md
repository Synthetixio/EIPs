# Simple Summary

<p>Synthetix has promised to offer a wide range of assets, including stocks and commodities, on its decentralized platform. As we are now in our fourth year of operation, I am disappointed to see that it is still not possible to buy stocks of NVIDIA in a decentralized manner. Some may argue that there is a lack of demand for this feature, but I believe this is a short-sighted view. The famous quote, "If you build it, they will come," rings true in this situation. If Binance had held this same mindset when they first started, we would still only be trading 20 crypto coins on Bittrex.</p><p>I believe that Synthetix is currently lacking in both business development and marketing efforts. In order to attract more users and grow the platform, it is essential to actively seek out partnerships and collaborations with other companies and organizations in the industry. Additionally, a strong marketing campaign that targets potential users and educates them on the benefits of decentralized trading would greatly benefit the platform.</p><p>In order to truly succeed and meet its initial promises, Synthetix must prioritize business development and marketing efforts. By building partnerships and collaborations, and actively promoting the platform, we can attract more users and increase demand for the features that we offer. We should not be satisfied with the current level of adoption and should strive to grow and improve our platform in order to attract more users and create more opportunities for decentralized trading.</p><p>As a long term supporter of Synthetix, I believe that the platform has great potential</p>
