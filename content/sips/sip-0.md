# Specification


### Overview

<p>N/A</p>

### Rationale

<p>The <a href="https://truflation.com/marketplace/hedge-index" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Truflation Hedge Index</a> is an investment index that is selected to reduce the potential for loss from inflation given the rise in the cost of goods and services. As inflation is a global concern, the ability to protect against it is in increasingly high demand. By providing HEDGE as a tradeable PERP, traditional and crypto investors will be able to both hedge their portfolios as well as trade on the prediction of the direction of the Index itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Index coins combine the cultural movement of memetic assets with the market for thematic indexes.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="./assets/sip-0/cyd8kb.png"></p><p><br></p><p>Thematic indexes represents om $800B in AUM in traditional finance. These indexes take years to obtain approval and cost a minimum of $1/2M to create. At the same time pump.fun is making $22M/month.&nbsp;At the same time, Memetic assets have reached a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/meme-token" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">market cap of $73B with 24h trading volume of $18B</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>We see indexcoins reaching a $500B market cap with some $100B in daily trading volumes by the end of this decade.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Given the attention to Inflation and the desire for $HEDGE products to protect liquid assets against inflation, we are targeting a $7M daily trading volume for the $HEDGE product.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
