# Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP introduces a new governance body called the Risk Council, this council will consist of three members directly elected by token holders. The Risk Council will be responsible for risk analysis within the Protocol.

# Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The Risk Council will be responsible for:

- Establish a documented process for the analysis of risks within the Synthetix Protocol, including
    - An understanding of the Synthetix Protocols risk appetite
    - Methodology for quantitative/ qualitative assessment of risks
    - Maintain a registrar of known risks within the protocol
    - A process for considering risk in change (via SIP workflow)
    - A process for considering risk identified by community or protocol teams
- Execution of risk analysis to during the SIP life-cycle
- Execution of ad-hoc risk analysis as risks are identified
- Maintaining and reporting on risk management
- Providing risk analysis summaries for the Spartan Council to take in consideration when debating and voting on SIPs
- Ensuring that the implementation of SIPs to be deployed by the protocolDAO match the specification voted on by the Spartan Council.


# Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

In a complex system such as the Synthetix Protocol, there are significant risks to introducing changes into the Protocol. These risks can be introduced via changes internally, such as through the SIP process or externally, through ecosystem economics that may affect the Synthetix Network. The  current risk culture is ad-hoc and informal, this proposal describes a formal risk process suited to the Synthetix Protocol.

The Risk Council will proactively review protocol proposals as well as changes within the ecosystem in which Synthetix operates in order to identify and analyse potential risks. An effective risk program shall protect the value of the Synthetix Protocol by;
- Protect protocol value by identifying and managing risk  
- Analyse and describe risks to stakeholders 
- Improving understanding of risks to the synthetix protocol 
- Provide assurances to third parties (customers, business partners, and regulators) that the Synthetix protocol is robust and secure
    
As we continue moving towards decentralised governance, it is important we establish a body that solely focuses on risk.

# Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

The Risk Council (RC) will be responsible for analysis and reporting of risks within the Synthetix Protocol. More specifically the RC will initially be responsible for:

1.  The "Risk Analysis" stage that will be introduced in the SIP workflow
2.  Risk analysis of issues raised by synthetix team or community members
3.  Maintaining risk register, and protocol risk oversight
4.  Recommendations for SCCP based parameter changes, or other risk treatments

#### SIP Workflow

The RC will be responsible for an additional step in the SIP workflow which will run in parallel with the engineering "feasibility". In this step, the RC will conduct an in-depth risk analysis to provide to the Spartan Council to utilize during their debating and voting process.

Each SIP will be assigned an extra status decided on by the RC, from the following:

- Acceptable
- Caution
- Review Required
- Non-Acceptable

_Acceptable_

If a SIP is assigned this label, the RC has found that the change lies within the synthetic protocols risk appetite.

_Caution_

SIPs marked with this label require additional review and risk acceptance of the highlighted risks by the Spartan Council when debating and voting on the SIP.

_Unacceptable_

This label should be used by the RC if they believe a SIP creates an unacceptable risk to the Synthetix Protocol.

The assignment of each label will be based on a 2/3 majority vote, if all members wish to assign a separate label to a SIP they must each present their reasoning in an individual report to the Spartan Council prior to the SIP being presented.

#### Protocol Risk Oversight

Historically the management of risk has been dealt with on an ad-hoc basis by Core Contributors. The RC will be appointed the governance body responsible for managing risk in protocol policy changes (usually via SCCPs - such as proposed inflation or c-ratio changes). For SCCPs, the same process outlined in the SIP workflow applies.

For externally identified risks, the RC is responsible for providing a public forum to discuss and address any community concerns in relation to ecosystem developments that may impact the Synthetix Protocol as well as be proactive in managing overall risk.

The Risk Council is an informational body, they are responsible for assessing and reporting on protocol risk for the benefit of the community, the Spartan Council and protocolDAO retain ultimate responsibility for enacting and implementing recommendations by the Risk Council.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The existing system whereby risk assessment is not assigned to a particular individual or body presents an existential risk to the Protocol. There have been several incidents over the last year where a more thorough risk assessment could have significantly reduced the risk of SIP implementation. The rapid growth and development of the Synthetix Protocol and ecosystem has increased the bandwidth required to manage risk within Synthetix.

##### Operation

1. Risk Council Members elections will utilise the voting strategy of the Spartan Council elections (quadratic-weighted debt)
2. Risk Council members will be made known to the community and the Treasury Council will assign a budget to pay for the RC members stipends
3. The SIP workflow will be amended to include the "Risk Analysis" stage

In addition the TC will set a budget for external risk assessment by the Risk Council through engagement with external service providers.

### Examples

#### Risk Analysis

A community member authors a SIP, to create a new string of liquidity incentive pools. The SIP is merged by the SIP editors and labeled as "Draft". During the CC Sprint Planning, an engineer is assigned to the SIP for feasibility, and the assignee notifies the Risk Council members via Discord that there is a new SIP that they are conducting feasibility research on.

The Risk Council schedule a meeting to discuss how the introduction of liquidity incentive pools (in which sUSD is part of the proposed plan) might affect the system and they come to the conclusion that it might cause the sUSD to de-peg. They label it "Review Required" as they think it might be viable to pass if they remove the sUSD pool from the proposal.

#### Internal Protocol Oversight

A SCCP is made that proposes to decrease the c-ratio to 10%, the Risk Council upon seeing this SCCP holds a discussion and ultimately comes to the conclusion that it does not fall within the Synthetix risk appetite and assigns it a risk summary of "Not Acceptable".

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
