## Simple Summary

The SIP proposes deprecating classic exchanges (and atomic exchanges) on **all** non sUSD tokens in favor of a new redeemer contract that redeems users at the Chainlink price multiplied by a discountRate. This discountRate would start at 1 and could decrease gradually according to a pre-approved schedule that can be voted on by governance with an SCCP.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

After this SIP is implemented, users holding non sUSD (like sETH, sBTC) will only be able to redeem their synths for sUSD at the Chainlink price multiplied by the specified discount factor.

## Motivation

The legacy spot synths are overutilsed relative to their value to stakers, they produce minimal revenue and incur significant hedging costs for stakers. Spot synths in V3 have been redesigned to be more aligned with the interests of stakers, this proposal will immediately begin to reduce the debt pool skew, and the costs associated with stakers managing their debt hedging due to changes in the composition of outstanding synths. It also prepares for the migration of debt to V3 later in the year as new products are launched, including the upcoming L1 ETH perp.

## Specification

The `discountFactor` starts in week 0 at 1. Should the system be configured to levy a funding rate of 30% per year for example, at the weekly fee period close, the keeper bot would update the discountFactor to `0.99423076923` which is computed as per `prevailing_discount_factor*(1-funding_rate_per_year*weeks_since_last_update/weeks_per_year)`.
