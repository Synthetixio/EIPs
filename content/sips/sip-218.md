## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Move the 6,000 SNX reward emission from current sUSD pool to Optimism metapool at `0x061b87122Ed14b9526A813209C8a59a633257bAb` by adding reward to gauge or staking eqivalent.


## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Curve sUSD pool has played a very big role in pegging sUSD since its existence. Currently, 6,000 SNX is minted per week as reward for depositing in the pool. ~~However with the permissionless metapool deployment from Curve, moving sUSD to metapool will improve exchange rate of sUSD on L1.~~ After community consideration, this inflation will be used to incentivize L2 metapool now.

## Process Outline

0. When calculating L2 distribution, add 6000 SNX
1. Remove `RewardDistribution` entry in L1.
2. Add Optimism `RewardDistribution` entry to send SNX to pool gauge / `StakingRewards` eqivalent.
