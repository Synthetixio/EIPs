<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes diverting 20% of weekly inflation to trading incentives on Perps. 

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The perps contracts have now been on mainnet for several months, while the mechanism requires some improvments that are already planned for perps V2, it is time to start incentivising trading volume and open interest. This SIP proposes to divert 20% of weekly inflation to a users of perps based on trading volume and open interest. This inflation will be escrowed for 1 year and distributed monthly in arrears.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

With the recent launch of the OP token, and the growth in the Optimism ecosystem it is time to begin incentives for Perps to encourage both trading volume and open interest.
## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->



### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Funds create a clean abstraction for provisioning liquidity and sUSD issuance. An alternative approach could involve a separate contract for managing all collateral in the system, another contract to manage minting and burning sUSD, and then allowing accounts to provide liquidity directly to markets. This is not desirable because it adds unnecessary components to the system and significantly increases the implementation complexity of features like delegated staking positions.

It may seem as if we could allow funds to decide which types of collateral are acceptable, rather than configuring this across the entire protocol. This is not an option because we want to allow sUSD to be fungible (regardless of the fund from which it was minted). In other words, we need to prevent the creation of a fund that accepts low quality collateral, exposing all sUSD holders to that risk.

We also considered scoping in functionality that would allow a fund creator to prevent others from joining a fund without permission. This has not been included as this would only inconvenience users, given that a fund’s staking position is transparent. This will be revisited in future SIPs which address liquidations.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

Funds will implement the following interface:

```solidity
IFund {
	function createFund(uint requestedFundId, address owner);
	function accountFundDebt(uint fundId, uint accountId, address collateralType);
	function fundDebt(uint fundId);
	function totalDebtShares(uint fundId);
	function debtPerShare(uint fundId);
	function collateralizationRatio(uint fundId, uint accountId, address collateralType);
	function delegateCollateral(uint fundId, uint accountId, address collateralType, uint amount, uint exposure);
	function mint(uint fundId, uint accountId, address collateralType, uint amount);
	function burn(uint fundId, uint accountId, address collateralType, uint amount);
	function rebalanceMarkets(uint fundId);
	function setFundPosition(uint fundId, uint[] markets, uint[] weights);
	function nominateFundOwner(uint fundId, address owner);
	function acceptFundOwnership(uint fundId);
	function renounceFundOwnership(uint fundId);
}
```

**Creating Funds**  
Funds can be created by anyone using the `createFund()` function. The owner (and only the owner) has the ability to update the fund’s staking position (by calling `setFundPosition()`) and nominate a new owner for the fund with `nominateFundOwner()`. The nominated owner can call `acceptFundOwnership()` to become the owner. An owner can also call `renounceFundOwnership()`, effectively making the fund’s position permanent.

**Delegating Collateral**  
Stakers can call the `delegateCollateral()` function, which will automatically create or update the relevant `CollateralEntry` (specified below) based on the provided parameters. It then triggers the `rebalanceMarkets()` function to notify each of the markets that the amount of liquidity available has changed. Stakers may only unassign collateral if the resulting C-Ratio is above the Target C-Ratio for that collateral’s type.

```solidity
struct CollateralEntry {
	uint accountId;
	address collateralType;
	uint collateralAmount;
	uint leverage;
	uint initialDebt;
	uint withdrawn;
	int usdBalance;
}
```

**Minting and Burning sUSD**  
Accounts may mint and burn sUSD backed by a collateral type that they have staked. sUSD is an ERC-20 token (with `permit` functionality) that is accepted by the market manager.

Minting and burning will increase and decrease the `usdBalance` value, respectively. Stakers may only mint sUSD if the resulting C-Ratio is above the Target C-Ratio for the relevant collateral type.

**Configuring Staking Position**  
The owner of a fund is able to invoke the `setFundPosition()` function with an array of markets and their corresponding weights. For example, assigning the sBTC market a weight of 1 and the sEUR market a weight of 2 would indicate that one third of the liquidity in this fund should be provided to the sBTC market and two thirds should be provided to the sEUR market. `rebalanceMarkets()` is called whenever the staking position of a fund is manipulated.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

- Preferred Fund (*uint*) - This is the ID of a fund which the Spartan Council prefers that stakers join. This will be the default fund for stakers in the official UI.
- Approved Funds (*uint[]*) - This is a list of funds’ IDs owned (or otherwise approved) by the Spartan Council and will be listed in the official UI.
