<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor.

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Delist Debt-Perp to remove unnecessary risk to protocol health.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The Debt-Perp offers little benefit to the protocol while adding an unnecessary amount of risk due to deterministic profitable trades. Unique situations allow for this perp to be taken advantage of.

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

Delist the Debt-Perp to improve the future health of the protocol.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The most recent bad debt liquidations shed light on how unique situations allow for the Debt-Perp to be used for deterministic trades affecting the debt pool. 

Case Study:
On 2022-10-22 07:51 there was a liquidation of $763,021 of debt. At the next SDS oracle price (07:55) update there was an increase of 1.02%. During the bad debt liquidation SDS price went from 1.21 to 1.24 and over $3,000,000 of debt was liquidated. Traders that anticipated the bad debt absorption into the debt pool had an almost guaranteed profit depending on the timeframe liquidations happened over (funding rate ~0.013% 1H). This resulted in a few traders being able to profit off the debt absorption. Additionally, this may be an avenue for future profitable trade attacks where latency between liquidation and oracle update allows for traders to bid after a liquidation happens and before the oracle update. In the case study example someone could have seen the liquidation at 07:51 and opened a position within the 4 minute window for a guaranteed return. 

This thing offers no positive value and only risk for highly profitable trading strategies. So we should try to get rid of it.
