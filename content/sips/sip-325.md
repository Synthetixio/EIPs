## Title: Use of Fees for SNX Buyback and Distribution to SNX Stakers

### Author: dsacks

### Discussions-To: Synthetix Discord

### Status: Draft

### Created: 2023-06-10

---

### Simple Summary

This SIP proposes to use a portion of the fees generated from the Synethetix platform for buying back SNX from decentralized exchanges and distributing it to SNX stakers.

---

### Abstract

The SIP suggests using a predetermined percentage of the fees generated by Synthetix users for buying SNX from decentralized exchanges. The acquired SNX will then be distributed proportionately to all current SNX stakers in liquid SNX form. This mechanism is intended to strengthen the demand for the SNX token and further secure the Synthetix ecosystem.

---

### Motivation

The primary motivation for this proposal is to create a positive feedback loop for the SNX token by directly recycling fees into value capture for the SNX token. SNX stakers will continue to receive their earned proportion of fees, but in liquid SNX form. Considering the importance of SNX token price on sUSD liquidity, this mechanism aims to continue to incentivize stakers through their active involvement in the network, while simultaneously fostering the stability of the Synthetix ecosystem by stimulating buying pressure.

### Specification

#### Overview

The mechanism to be implemented involves the automatic conversion of a certain percentage of fees into SNX tokens via DEXs. The acquired SNX tokens will then be distributed amongst SNX stakers in liquid SNX.

#### Rationale

This approach enables a positive feedback loop, where the success of protocol fee generation directly benefits SNX stakers and thus the entire Synthetix network. It also enhances the appeal of the SNX token, potentially attracting more participants and increasing the overall security and stability of the network.

#### Technical Specification

1. **Fee Conversion:** A smart contract will be implemented that converts a percentage of fees into SNX tokens. This contract will interact with a DEX or DEX aggregator to perform the conversion.
2. **SNX Distribution:** The acquired SNX tokens will be distributed proportionately to all current SNX stakers. The distribution will take place on a weekly basis.
3. **Parameters:** The percentage of fees used for SNX acquisition and the frequency of distribution will be adjustable parameters, which can be modified via SCCP.

### Test Cases

The following scenarios will be tested:

1. Conversion of fees into SNX tokens.
2. Distribution of SNX tokens to stakers.
3. Modification of parameters.

---

### Implementation

Upon approval of this SIP, the proposed changes will be developed and implemented in the Synthetix protocol.
