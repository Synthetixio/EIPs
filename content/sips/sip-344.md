## Simple Summary
Buyback and burn SNX on Base, with fees earned on Base.

## Abstract

After any share to integrators, use 50% of fees earned by ETH collateral, and all of the fees earned by SNX collateral, to buy and burn SNX via dutch auction.

## Motivation
Fees from the isolated Base deployment need to go somewhere.

## Specification
