## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This sip aims to improving the user experience by allowing users to close a position completely regardless of the margin requirements.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The current perps v3 design allows users to decrease an existing open position size, as long as the users' available margin is above the required margin in the [post state](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/main/markets/perps-market/contracts/storage/PerpsMarket.sol#L365). This SIP proposes to alleviate this requirement when a user is performing a full close of an existing open position.


## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The main reason is that the perps v3 design does not allow for simultaneous orders to be executed and therefore users could be required to increase their margin before being allowed to reduce their positions. Hence, the need a bypass when a user commits to a full close of an existing open position.
It is worth mentioning that the reason behind this check is to encourage users to increase their buffers back above the initial margin requirements when they are reducing risk on the protocol. Hence circumventing this check would be allowed when a full close of an existing position is initiated by the user.
