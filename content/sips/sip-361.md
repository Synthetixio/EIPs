## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This sip introduces decentralized keeper contract that aims to  the [reportedDebt](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/main/markets/perps-market/contracts/modules/PerpsMarketFactoryModule.sol#L114) in a given supermarket lively. This addresses the risk of LP's exiting at favorable prices during times of market volatility.    

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->
The keeper contract would perform the following, when a keeper runs the `upkeep` call:
- Fetch the prevailing `reportedDebt` figure and saves it under `previousReportedDebt`
- Update the pyth price onchain (with vaa's provided by the keeper as part of the contract call)
- Fetches the latest `reportedDebt` figure and saves it under `latestReportedDebt`
- In case `abs(latestReportedDebt-previousReportedDebt) > minReportedDebtDeltaUSD` or `abs(latestReportedDebt-previousReportedDebt)/previousReportedDebt > minReportedDebtDeltaPercent` pays the keeper the gas associated with a single pyth price update + a profit margin (details in the Specification section). Otherwise the `upkeep` call reverts.


## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The current perps v3 design is based on a pull based oracle system where traders/lp's pull prices offchain and push it into the system. However, this opens up the risk of LP's exiting staking under certain circumstances in order to avoid incurring losses on their staked assets. Hence, this sip aims at addressing this situation by offering keepers an incentive to keeping prices lively under a controlled environment.
