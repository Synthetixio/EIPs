## Simple Summary

Deploy SnaxChain, an independent OP Chain specifically tuned for DeFi, to act as the primary home for Synthetix governance which manages deployments across all networks.

## Abstract

This SIP proposes the deployment of SnaxChain, a new OP Chain built using the OP Stack. The initial implementation will focus on deploying the new governance upgrade to SnaxChain, leveraging it as the primary governance platform for Synthetix. SnaxChain will operate independently alongside existing Synthetix deployments and will eventually serve as the mothership for governance across all networks. This proposal includes a comprehensive technical specification, cost analysis, and a discussion on the pros and cons of operating our own infrastructure versus relying on third-party services.

## Motivation

The current elections system for Synthetix v3 is siloed, leading to complexities and inefficiencies. By deploying SnaxChain, we aim to streamline governance operations, enhance security, and improvement the management of the Synthetix deployments across all networks. This initiative aligns with Synthetix's long-term vision of being efficient, permissionless, and achieving maximal decentralization.

## Specification

### Architecture

The SIP seeks approval for the new governance module deployment, designed for future readiness. Key components include:

    **Execution Layer**: Optimism's Superchain stack.
    **Data Availability**: ETH DA, Optimism’s span batching, and EIP-4844.
    **Oracle**: Multi-Chain oracle provider Pyth for low-latency market data.
    **Cross Chain**: Wormhole Messaging & Queries.
    **Chain ID**: 2192 ;)

SnaxChain will be deployed as a "vanilla OP Chain" using Ethereum L1 for both settlement and data availability. The deployment will follow the architecture outlined in the [OP Stack documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/explainer).

The decision to deploy SnaxChain as an independent OP Chain is driven by the need for a dedicated "priority DeFi" platform. By leveraging the OP Stack and Ethereum DA, we ensure compatibility and future-proofing for Synthetix. This approach balances immediate operational needs with long-term strategic goals of decentralization and security.

### Governance and Operations

SnaxChain will host the new governance implementation and the initial deployment will only include governance-related operations to minimize risk.
**Any future upgrades and deployments will require separate SIPs.**

### Infrastructure Costs

Below are approximate costs pertaining to infrastructure setup and maintenance costs for running nodes. Fortunately EIP-4844 lowered data availability costs across the board.

| **Monthly Net Revenue (Deducting sequencer and DA costs)** | **-7.12 ETH**                                           | **19.93 ETH**                                       | **13.7 ETH**                                        |

Given that SnaxChain will initially host governance operations, the transaction volume and chain activity is expected to be low:

### Pros and Cons

#### Running Own Infrastructure

- **Pros**:
  - Full control over the infrastructure and chain configuration.
  - Enhanced security and reliability.
  - Independence from third-party failures and policies.
- **Cons**:
  - Higher initial costs and complexity.
  - Requires dedicated resources for maintenance and upgrades.

#### Using Third-Party Solutions

- **Pros**:
  - Lower setup and maintenance costs.
  - Easier to implement and manage.
- **Cons**:
  - Incompatible with the Superchain standards.
  - Dependency on third-party services and their reliability.
  - Potential incompatibilities with future Synthetix upgrades.

For this initial SIP we propose to use Conduit to deploy SnaxChain and manage its infrastructure.

## Test Cases

- **Scenario 1**: Successful deployment and operation of governance contracts on SnaxChain.
- **Scenario 2**: Successful cross-chain interaction between SnaxChain and existing Synthetix deployments.
- **Scenario 3**: Cost analysis and performance metrics post-EIP-4844 vs third parties.

## Future Plans

Ultimately, Snaxchain is intended to be used for more than just elections and will host other financial products. That is out of scope for this proposal. Below are some notes on potential benefits:

### Transaction Execution Speed

Snaxchain aims to reduce transaction execution times and ensure timely liquidations during market volatility. L2 Appchains will enable ultra-cheap transactions, scaling to support high user volumes and algo trading bots.

In order to onboard as many users as CEXes have, our architecture needs to scale to support 100,000’s of users and potentially algo trading bots executing simultaneously during periods of volatility.

With Infinex focusing on providing CEX user experience and account abstraction, a Synthetix L2 would support the option to provide gas-less transactions for traders.

**Paymasters:** Tools like ThirdWeb, Alchemy, Biconomy already support account abstraction and gas-less transactions, subsidizing user’s transactions on your app with smart accounts.

Other use cases for SNX token could be developed, for example, staking SNX tokens for sponsored gas transactions for users on Infinex / Kwenta.

The gas subsidies of this would be in theory covered by the sequencer fees that the SNX sequencer is collecting.

**Trailing 90 days OP Chain Base Gas Fees:**

### Rebated Sequencer Fees for Perps Traders

As a priority chain for DeFi Traders and users offering low congestion on OP Stack, Synthetix Superchain will provide liquidity and rebated sequencer fees for perp traders on Snaxchain.

### Synthetix Chain Ecosystem

Opportunities to support a DeFi ecosystem with Synthetix’s liquidity layer as the underlying basis for many other protocols to build on top of Synthetix perp markets. Snaxchain will have partner applications like Uniswap, Curve, and other Defi partners to help boost the ecosystem's users, transactions, and growth.

### User Interfaces:

- Infinex
- Kwenta
- PolynomialFi

### DeFi Protocols

- Thales / Overtime
- Lyra Finance
- Dhedge
- Ethena
- Amphora
- TLX leverage tokens
- Atlantean
- Liquidity DEX on Snaxchain > Curve / Uniswap / Velodrome

### Bootstrapping Liquidity

Liquidity that is on Ethereum L1 and other major chains where SNX deposit contracts will be present. Infinex recent launch has shown ability to take deposits of USDC from EVM chains, Polygon sidechains and Solana.

### Interoperability - Cross-Chain Messaging for Liquidity Deposits

We propose utilizing Wormhole's cross-chain messaging to faciliate governance and create the best trader UX.

### Example Trader UX

- User deposits margin on any EVM L1 or Solana chain
- Give them a “loan” on Snaxchain for the deposited margin to trade with and take a small amount of the margin to give them gas to trade with on the destination chain for a smoother experience.
- Settle the margin amounts after PnL and withdraw on the source chain they deposited on.

### App-Chain Strategy

**We want to incentivize:**

- Traders using Snaxchain to trade to generate fees and activity.
- Liquidity providers on Snaxchain to provide assets for sufficient liquidity.
- Users can create a new LP and long tail markets on Synthetix V3 that are supported by Pyth price feeds.
