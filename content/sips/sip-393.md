network: Base
status: Draft
type: Governance

## Simple Summary

Add a new pool to V3 on Base explicitly for experimenting with long-tail or experimental assets for perps trading.

## Abstract

This proposal outlines a plan for a new Synthetix V3 pool on Base which we are calling “Degenthix.” This will allow for the trading of long-tail assets with a large demand for perps trading with separate liquidity from the primary Spartan Pool.

## Motivation

Given the nature of Synthetix V3’s design, we have the ability to create more experimental pools with completely separate risk profiles and exposure to the primary Spartan Pool. A pool explicitly created for the trading of highly demanded but long-tail assets allows for this testing ground to satisfy that demand, separate the risk, and trial assets for their eventual absorption into the Spartan Pool.

The pool will be owned by the Spartan Council, where any changes to the listed assets or the configurations will need to go through the same governance process as the Spartan Pool, but with less strict requirements given the nature and goal of this pool.

We are proposing five assets to start the pool: AERO, VELO, PRIME, MAGA, BODEN. We are also looking to add a ratio of MAGA/BODEN to act as an election market.


### Technical Specification

Create a new pool, setting the Spartan Council as the owner and the name as “Degenthetix”.

- createPool(2 , [Spartan Council])
- setPoolName(2 , “Degenthetix”)

Initialize a new “Degenthetix” supermarket for the trading of these specific perps with the same specs as Perps V3.

Set OI caps for each asset respective to their market cap.

- MAGA: 400,000
- AERO: 400,000
- MAGA/BODEN: 300,000
- PRIME: 200,000
- BODEN: 200,000
- VELO: 150,000
