## Simple Summary

This SIP proposes to add support for Aave's GHO Stablecoin (GHO) as Collateral and Margin on Synthetix v3 on Arbitrum.

## Abstract

This SIP proposes enabling GHO to be used as Collateral and Margin on Arbitrum with a 10M cap.

## Motivation

With the high returns from deposits in lending markets and the low risk profile of Aave Protocol, boasting over $35B in TVL, integrating stataGHO into Synthetixâ€™s Arbitrum LP will provide a competitive edge.

Users will gain access to dual-yield opportunities, combining rewards from DeFi lending and perpetual trading. Additionally, these liquidity pools will exhibit greater resilience to fee-share experimentation, enhancing their appeal.

GHO is a USD pegged decentralized multi-collateral stablecoin that is fully backed, transparent and native to the Aave Protocol with over [160M](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/gho) of circulating supply and a [3.2 collateral ratio](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/collateral).

Onboarding GHO as Collateral and Margin enables users the choice of earning yield from Synthetix and Aave Protocol, or supporting active trading positions.
