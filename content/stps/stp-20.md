## Simple Summary
This proposal outlines the establishment of an exempted foundation company ("Foundation") under the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands to act on behalf of the Synthetix DAO. The Foundation is designed as a non-profit entity to enable interactions with traditional businesses and enhance operational capabilities.

## Abstract
The proposal seeks to establish a Cayman Islands exempted foundation company to support Synthetix DAO's operations. The Foundation will require up to $120,000 to establish and $50,000 annually to operate.

## Specification
*The tokens, amounts, and destinations, and schedule of funds to be moved*.

- **Type of Entity:** Cayman Islands exempted foundation company, which includes at least one Cayman Islands-based Board Member, a Supervisor, and a Secretary, as required by Cayman Islands law.
- **Funding:** Funding for incorporation and maintenance will come from the DAO's treasury, with provisions for ongoing operational costs included in the DAO's annual budget.
- **Foundation Treasury:** The Foundation will maintain a separate treasury from the DAO. The Foundation's board will be responsible for funding this treasury as needed and in compliance with applicable laws.
- **Limitations:**
  - **Independent Director:** DAO contributors will not own shares or any other ownership interest in the Foundation. This entity will hire a fiduciary in the Cayman Islands as its Ultimate Beneficial Owner.
  - **No Limited Liability Protection:** This entity does not provide limited liability protection to DAO contributors but serves as a service provider to the DAO.

## Financial Specification
- **Legal and Initial Setup Costs:** Estimated between $100,000 to $120,000, covering legal advice on the Foundation's structure, operations, registration fees, and initial operational expenses.
- **Ongoing Operations:** Managed by a DAO-appointed board, the entity will handle external legal interactions, including contract negotiations and compliance with international law, with estimated ongoing expenses of approximately $50,000 annually.

## Rationale
Establishing this legal entity allows the delegation of certain operational tasks to the Foundation, improving interactions with traditional businesses and legal frameworks. Similar structures have been successfully implemented by other DAOs such as ENS DAO and DYDX.
