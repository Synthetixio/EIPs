When opening a pull request to submit your STP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `stp-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed change intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
To enhance the effectiveness of Synthetix's marketing efforts, improve community engagement, and increase brand awareness, this proposal suggests the formation of a dedicated Marketing Workgroup. This group will focus on developing and executing a comprehensive marketing strategy.


## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what _will_ be done if the STP is implemented, not _why_ it should be done or _how_ it will be done. If the STP proposes sending X tokens to Y each week, write, "we propose to send X tokens to Y each week".-->

This STP proposes the creation of a Marketing Workgroup with the responsibility of spearheading marketing initiatives, content creation, and community engagement strategies for Synthetix. The workgroup will operate with a specific budget allocated from the Synthetix Treasury and will report directly to the Treasury Council and the broader community.


## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the STP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the STP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the STP will address the issue!-->

In recent times, Synthetix has identified a pressing need for more cohesive and aggressive marketing efforts to stay competitive and relevant in the fast-evolving DeFi landscape. The establishment of a Marketing Workgroup is critical for consolidating marketing efforts, fostering innovation, and driving the adoption of Synthetix platforms and products.
 

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Financial Specification
4. Configurable Values
-->
- **Workgroup Structure:** The Marketing Workgroup shall consist of a Lead Marketer, Content Creators, Social Media Managers, and Analysts.
- **Budget and Funding:** An initial budget of $xxx will be allocated for the first [Specify Duration], covering salaries, marketing tools, advertising, and promotional activities.
- **Goals and Objectives:** To develop a marketing strategy that aligns with Synthetix's vision, increase engagement across social platforms, and drive traffic and adoption.

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the STP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->



### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose this use of funds – what were the considerations. The rationale fleshes out the motivation and reasoning behind decisions that were made. It should describe any alternate ideas that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The formation of a Marketing Workgroup is expected to provide a focused approach to marketing and community engagement. By centralizing marketing efforts, Synthetix can achieve a consistent brand message, leverage analytics to inform strategies, and engage more effectively with its community and potential users.

### Financial Specification

<!--The financial specification should outline the the tokens, amounts, destinations, and schedule of funds to be moved. If appropriate, any technical considerations should also be included here – that is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->
