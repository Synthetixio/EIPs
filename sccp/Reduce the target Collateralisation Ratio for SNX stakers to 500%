## Simple Summary

Decrease the target Collateralisation Ratio for SNX stakers to 500%

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The system is much more stable with the first successful set of liquidations executing without a hitch. Its a good time to further lower c-rations to increase the opportunity to mint more debt and increase returns for synth holders and traders

## Motivation

- Liquidation process in place and working
- Network and Active c-ratio are a very health 783% and 635% respectfully, even with recent drop in SNX price
- Increased liquidity will support increased use of the exchange(s) and transaction fees
- Capital Efficiency
- Increased demand for synths will drive more integrations with other DeFi platforms
