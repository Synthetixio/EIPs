## Simple Summary

List BOME-PERP, ETHFI-PERP, and PENDLE-PERP on Perps v3 on the Base network.

## Abstract

List BOME-PERP, ETHFI-PERP, and PENDLE-PERP markets on Perps v3 on the Base network, expanding the range of v3 markets to include three additional markets which have captured much attention and interest in the crypto ecosystem. 

## Motivation

Following the listing and early success of WIF-PERP - currently the highest volume asset on Perps v3 on Base, above BTC-PERP and ETH-PERP - we should strive to add markets for assets which have captured crypto ecosystem interest as quickly as possible. 

BOME is a Solana memecoin which launched March 14 and became tradeable on Binance on March 16. It immediately surged to 1.5B market cap and is currently sitting at just under $1B. As of April 6, it has $365M of 24H volume and $83M OI on Binance perps.

ETHFI is the governance token for Ether.Fi, a non-custodial liquid restaking protocol on Ethereum. The token launched on March 18 and was immediately tradeable on various centralized exchanges. As of April 6, it has $260M of 24H volume and $50M OI on Binance perps.

PENDLE is the governance token for Pendle Finance, a DeFi protocol that enables the tokenization and trading of future yield on Ethereum, which launched on April 27, 2021. PENDLE recently enabled high value markets for various yield-bearing and point-accruing opportunities, namely for various flavors of staked ETH and Ethena's USDe, which have captured much of the crypto ecosystem's attention. PENDLE-PERP is currently listed on Perps v2 on Optimism. As of April 6, it has $256M of 24H volume and $61M of OI on Binance.


## Specification

### Rationale

All three markets are currently in the top 20 highest volume perps markets on Binance. All three markets have extremely deep liquidity on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. BOME and ETHFI in particular are noticeably absent from competing perps exchanges. Listing these markets furthers the goal of making Perps v3 the best place to trade the assets that users want to trade, when they want to trade them. 

### Technical Specification

- Requires a Pyth oracle on Base for each market.

### Test Cases

- n/a

### Configurable Values

- To be set via SCCP for each market.
