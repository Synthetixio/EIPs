## Simple Summary
This SIP proposes to divert the 25,000 SNX weekly incentives for L2 from the sDAO (via the pDAO), to instead come from the inflationary SNX supply.

## Abstract
This SIP will change the funding source of the 25,000 weekly incentives for L2 from the sDAO (via the pDAO) to the inflationary supply of the SNX.

## Motivation
To move the weekly L2 incentives to come from the inflationary supply and away from the short term interim solution that was the sDAO (via the pDAO).

### Rationale
To use the intended inflationary supply for these SNX incentives. 

### Technical Specification
No contract changes are required as the inflation diversion has been anticipated and the functionality has already been implemented previously. The steps in order to activate the diversion and the whole transaction flow are described below:
1. The `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` contract must be added as a `RewardsDistribution` recipient via `RewardsDistributions.addDistribution(SynthetixBridgeToOptimism.address, 25000e18)`.

2. From now and on, every time `Synthetix.mint()` is invoked succesfully, 25K SNX will be sent to `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` via `RewardsDistribution.distributeRewards()` which
 calls `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism.notifyRewardAmount()` that locks the SNX into `SynthetixBridgeEscrow` and sends a `finalizeRewardDeposit` message to L2.

3. When the L2 transaction is processed, `SynthetixBridgeToBase.finalizeRewardDeposit` is invoked and subsequently `MintableSynthetix.mintSecondaryRewards()` is called, minting and distributing the rewards on L2.

### Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
Test net test on Kovan first. 

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)
