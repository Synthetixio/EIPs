<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor.

# Simple Summary

This proposal seeks to elevate the current Synthetix Governance System, addressing pain points that have been identified during the first version of governance as well as proposing new processes and tools to improve the self-autonomy and efficiency of the Synthetix DAOs.

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

# Abstract

If this proposal is approved and adopted, the following subsets of the Synthetix Governance system will change

- The tools used and processes followed for the nomination and election of DAO members
- The flow which ideas for proposals are expressed, debated and subsequently how proposals are authored
- A formal workflow of assigning directly responsible individual(s) for both the implementation and execution of proposals.

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

# Motivation

We have identified ‘inefficiencies’ that are negatively impacting on the overall Governance process and user experience of the Synthetix community. This SIP aims to address these ‘inefficiencies’ and drastically improve the underlying processes & tools for the community, when engaging with Synthetix Governance. We also aim to reduce the dependency on individuals and automate certain processes.

# Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

Release a separate governance UI to support features relating to the DAO nomination and election process as well as the SIP/SCCP discussions and voting process.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

TBD

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

TBD

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
